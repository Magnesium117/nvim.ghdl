THIS should probably not be public. it is an adaptation of another project in progress UNTESTED.
It uses code from:
 - https://github.com/anurag3301/nvim-platformio.lua/tree/main
 - https://github.com/harningt/luajson
 - https://github.com/amb5l/PyVCD2GTKW/tree/main
and thus is just other projects hacked together to make it work for me.
